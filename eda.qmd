This exploratory data analysis (EDA) aims to uncover insights from two combined datasets—one containing lagged sentiment data from the second half of the previous year and the other with current sentiment data from the first half of this year. By integrating customer data with sentiment scores, this analysis seeks to explore how customer sentiment correlates with key variables such as Customer Lifetime Value, coverage types, financial metrics, and policy details across different states and time periods. Through the lens of five key research questions, the analysis will identify trends, patterns, and relationships to provide a deeper understanding of the interplay between customer sentiment and various attributes, paving the way for actionable insights.

The plot illustrates the sentiment trends for five states over the period from June 2023 to July 2024. Nevada consistently exhibits the most negative sentiment, particularly in October and November 2023, where its sentiment scores are significantly lower than other states. In contrast, California tends to show relatively positive sentiment throughout the timeline, with peaks in July 2023 and smaller variations compared to other states. Arizona shows fluctuating sentiment, occasionally trending upwards to positive values in February 2024. States like Oregon and Washington exhibit moderately negative sentiment, though Washington stands out with occasional positive spikes, such as in October 2023. Overall, the months of October and November 2023 demonstrate downward sentiment trends across most states, while February 2024 shows improvement for several states, such as Nevada and Arizona. Similar patterns are seen between Oregon and Washington, which generally move in the same direction during several months.

This table above summarizes the distribution of sentiment categories (Negative, Neutral, Positive, Strong Negative, Strong Positive) for each state based on auto insurance-related sentiment data. California, Oregon, and Washington have the highest counts of negative sentiments, implying potential dissatisfaction in these regions. Nevada is the only state with presence of strong positive sentiments, but it is also the state with the presense of highest negative. This suggests that Nevada auto insurance sentiments tend to change rapidly and aggressively from one month to another. Oregon and Arizona exhibit relatively balanced counts among the categories, with more positive sentiments than strong extremes. Overall, all five states have higher average negative sentiments for each month within the year than the positive ones, which suggests all states more dissatisfied auto insurance related customers than the satisfied ones.

This table summarizes customer metrics by marital status:

-   **Divorced**: Customers pay the highest average premium (\$127.30) and have moderate claim amounts (\$556.37) and income (\$57,178.83).
-   **Married**: Customers have the highest number of customers (2,153), the lowest average claim amount (\$512.37), and the highest income (\$60,943.99).
-   **Single**: Customers pay the lowest average premium (\$124.89), have the highest average claim amount (\$745.57), and the lowest income (\$30,615.05).

This suggests that marital status significantly influences these financial metrics.

The chart shows the distribution of Customer Lifetime Value across vehicle classes and marital status. "Four-Door Cars" and SUVs are leading the customer preference, dominated by married customers who also represent a larger share of higher CLV tiers. Single customers are more equitably distributed across vehicle classes but less concentrated in high-value segments, while divorced customers have the smallest representation overall, with fewer high-value customers. Low and medium categories are leading most of the vehicle classes, which shows an opportunity to increase the high-value customers. The businesses can be targeted towards married customers in the high-value vehicle categories of "Four-Door Cars" and SUVs while exploring strategies for engaging and upselling single and divorced customers in niche categories such as "Luxury Cars" and "Luxury SUVs."

This Sankey diagram visualizes the flow of sentiments across three subreddits—cars, legaladvice, and personalfinance—from June 2023 to July 2024. The diagram is divided into five sentiment categories: Strong Positive, Positive, Neutral, Negative, and Strong Negative. Legaladvice consistently exhibits a high volume of Strong Negative sentiment, reflecting that many users in this subreddit are seeking help for difficult or negative situations. Despite the predominance of negative sentiment, there are fluctuations in Positive and Neutral sentiments, suggesting that while a significant portion of discussions is focused on negative experiences, there are also moments of positive or neutral advice shared.

In the Personalfinance subreddit, Strong Positive sentiment takes up a larger share, indicating that conversations are primarily centered around positive financial experiences and achievements. However, there also exists negative sentiments, revealing that not all discussions in this subreddit are positive. The Cars subreddit shows relatively lower activity compared to the other two, suggesting limited engagement in the topic.

This plot offers valuable insights into how sentiments evolve for each subreddit during the time period, helping to identify the most prominent sentiment categories and trends throughout the year.

To gain a deeper understanding of sentiment trends across subreddits, we calculated the normalized sentiment counts for each subreddit and month. This normalization helped us compare the sentiment distributions across subreddits by adjusting for differences in total activity levels. Even after normalization, we observed that LegalAdvice exhibited a consistent dominance of strong negative sentiments, suggesting that discussions within this subreddit tend to be more focused on challenging or negative legal situations.

Interestingly, the Cars subreddit showed a more diverse range of sentiments, with strong positive, positive, and negative sentiments being notably present. This suggests the existence of two distinct groups within the community—those who are satisfied with their cars and those who are dissatisfied. These variations in sentiment could be influenced by factors such as the type of vehicle, the model, or individual experiences related to car ownership.

Overall, the results suggest that while conversations around LegalAdvice and PersonalFinance tend to maintain a steady sentiment, discussions about Cars reflect a broader emotional spectrum, possibly due to varying personal experiences related to vehicle ownership.

In this bubble chart, we explore whether certain states have a higher number of posts or comments associated with specific sentiments, aiming to identify if any state stands out with a particular sentiment that is notably prevalent. What we observed is that California had the largest number of posts and comments across all sentiment categories, indicating that this state has a significantly higher volume of activity compared to others. This results in an imbalance in the number of posts and comments across the states, with California’s dominance clearly visible. The chart also reveals that most of the posts in California are associated with Strong Negative and Strong Positive sentiments, suggesting that discussions in this state tend to involve extreme emotional tones, whether positive or negative.

When looking at other states, we notice that Strong Negative sentiment is the most prevalent sentiment. This indicates that in all of the five states, the conversations are largely focused on negative experiences or challenging situations. In contrast to California, where strong positive and negative sentiments are more balanced, other states seem to lean more towards negative sentiments.

Overall, the plot provides a clear visualization of how sentiments are distributed across different states, with notable trends such as California’s high volume of extreme sentiments and the dominance of Strong Negative sentiment in most other states. This allows us to gain valuable insights into how different states engage with various emotional tones in online discussions throughout the year.

Lastly, we wanted to examine how sentiment scores varied across different states over time. To achieve this, we used a geoplot to visualize sentiment distribution by state, showing how sentiment shifted from one month to another. This plot provides a geographical view of sentiment scores across states, allowing us to identify regional trends and how they evolved over the year. By observing the colors representing sentiment intensities and changes over time, we can track fluctuations in sentiment across different areas, revealing patterns of positive, neutral, and negative sentiment across the country.

From the geoplot, we can see that California consistently exhibits high levels of Positive sentiment, particularly in the summer months, with a noticeable peak in June 2024. This trend suggests that conversations in California are generally more positive, especially around events or topics that likely resonate with residents during this time. Meanwhile, Nevada shows a more mixed sentiment distribution, with both Neutral and Negative sentiments appearing prominently throughout the year. Interestingly, Strong Negative sentiment rises slightly during the winter months, possibly reflecting seasonal or local events. In Oregon, Negative sentiment appears more frequently compared to other states, with Neutral sentiments fluctuating, especially around November 2023. The emotional tone in Oregon seems more balanced, with less drastic swings between positive and negative sentiments. Washington displays a slightly higher amount of Neutral sentiment, indicating that posts from this state are generally more balanced or indifferent in tone. The Strong Negative sentiment in Washington is notably low, suggesting fewer extreme negative emotions in the discourse compared to the other states. Finally, Arizona shows more Neutral sentiment across the year, with occasional spikes in Strong Positive sentiment, particularly in April 2024. The state’s sentiment distribution appears more stable, with fewer fluctuations in extreme emotional tones.
