This project successfully addressed two key questions about customer sentiment in the auto insurance domain using clustering analysis. In the **Current Sentiment Clustering analysis**, we segmented customers into eight distinct groups, revealing meaningful patterns between sentiment, income, and claims behavior. **Positive sentiment was associated with satisfied customers who filed fewer claims, while negative sentiment correlated with higher claim amounts, reflecting dissatisfaction**. Notably, **lower-income customers exhibited higher claim amounts**, possibly due to residing in higher-risk areas. Additionally, a strong positive correlation between monthly premiums and claim amounts suggests that **customers with more extensive coverage tend to file larger claims.** These insights emphasize the value of real-time sentiment monitoring for predicting claims and improving customer satisfaction.

In the **Lagged Sentiment Clustering**, we explored the relationship between past customer sentiment (2023 data) and future behaviors (2024 data). **We found that customers with higher Customer Lifetime Value, Monthly Premium Auto payments, and more comprehensive policies exhibit lower sentiment scores, suggesting dissatisfaction among high-value customers. Additionally, lower-income customers displayed slightly higher sentiment scores**, likely reflecting modest expectations and perceived value from simpler policies. These insights demonstrated the potential of lagged sentiment data for predicting customer satisfaction trends and identifying emerging risks.

Through this project, we gained experience in integrating external data with Reddit sentiment analysis and leveraging NLP and clustering techniques for actionable insights. **For future work, we propose focusing on more specific aspects of auto insurance sentiment, such as claims or premiums, instead of general auto insurnace sentiments. Expanding the dataset to include additional subreddits and extending the time period beyond one year** could provide richer data for state-level analyses and enable more precise sentiment predictions for external variables. This approach could further refine our understanding of customer satisfaction and enhance predictive accuracy in the auto insurance industry.
