title: "Sentiment-Driven Customer Segmentation in Auto Insurance"
---

This project aims to explore customer sentiment in the auto insurance industry by leveraging Reddit discussions and external customer data. By combining lagged and current sentiment data with customer attributes, the goal is to identify patterns and relationships that influence customer behavior and satisfaction. Through clustering analysis, we aim to segment customers based on their sentiment and associated features such as financial, policy-related, and demographic variables. These insights can help businesses better understand customer needs, improve policy offerings, and enhance overall customer experience. The analysis includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), natural language processing (NLP) for sentiment extraction, and machine learning (ML) techniques to cluster customers effectively.

## Question 2

How do **past customer sentiments** (lagged sentiments) predict or relate to customer segments based on their later behavior and insurance choices?\
:::

Using lagged customer sentiments, this question investigates past customer sentiments from June 2023 to December 2023 (from Reddit) and their relationship with auto insurance data for June 2024 to December 2024. This analysis involves exploring how lagged Reddit sentiment trends align with subsequent customer behavior and decisions.
